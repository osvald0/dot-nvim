# Neovim Setup

This is my personal Neovim config, built from the ground up after using LazyVim for a while.  
I wanted to better understand and control my setup, so I'm rebuilding everything step by step.

Even though this setup isn’t based on the LazyVim anymore, I’ve learned a lot from plugin
documentation and from browsing other people’s configs. This repo is basically me piecing
things together as I go.

It's a work in progress, expect things to evolve as I go.
